This project attempts to design a Convolutional Neural Network to detect Cardiomegaly and Pleural Effusion in X-rays. The data is from Kaggle's NIH Chest X-ray Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data.

Test Accuracy was high (96-97%) but this is a work in progress. Issues to be tackled - class imbalance, precision/recall, callbacks, image augmentation. Will attempt to use Transfer learning with the ResNet50V2 model and EfficientNet as well to increase robustness of model.
